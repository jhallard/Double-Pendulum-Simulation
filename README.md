Double-Pendulum-Simulation
==========================

All of the code used to make the simulations and graphics in these posts [(1, ](https://jhallard.com/blog/double_pendulum.html)[2, ](https://jhallard.com/blog/double_pendulum_2.html)[3)](#) on my blog. Included are implementations of a double-pendulum simulator in the Matlab, Python, and C++ programming languages, along with some 3rd party libraries for graphing help.
